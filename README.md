Game of Sticks: given 10 sticks, you and another player can only pick 1-3 sticks each turn. If a player picks a stick such that the total is 1 or lesser, the game ends and that player wins. The other player loses.
This program simulates that game in which two players can input their turn of picking sticks, until one loses.
